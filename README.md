# WEBAPP project
**_This project contains RESTful Web Application that allows Users to create multiple products and each product can have multiple images_**

## Web Application:
> Technologies Used: NodeJS, ExpressJS, Sequelize ORM
> Database: MySQL
> Libraries Used: Bcrypt (password encryption), dotenv, mysql2, chai & mocha (testing), aws-sdk, multer (middleware for uploading files), statsd (monitoring), winston (logging)

_This application can be hosted on AWS **EC2**, MySQL on **RDS**, **S3** bucket to store images, **Cloudwatch** to view monitoring metrics and application logs

## Continuous Integration

_**Github Actions** has been used for CI pipeline that verifies the code being merged (by running unit and integration tests) and creates image of the new code using **Packer** which is then made available as **AMI** in AWS across DEV and PROD accounts_



This project is part of coursework for **CSYE 6225**
